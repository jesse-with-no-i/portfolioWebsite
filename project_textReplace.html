    <h4>Project Description</h4>
    <p>Text Replacer is a python-based GUI application that performs several "find
        and replace" operations on a text file or multiple text files that the user
        chooses. It is a simple project that I made to address an issue I
        frequently ran into while taking online notes for my class. </p>

    <p>Since my class used a lot of special characters like Greek letters and
        mathematical symbols, I would often have to slow down to find the right
        character and insert in in the middle of taking notes. This caused me to miss
        parts of the lecture. My solution was to write the name of the symbol that
        I needed in lieu of the symbol itself, and then find and replace the symbols
        at the end of the lecture.</p>

    <h2>Demo:</h2>
    <h5>Selecting a text file</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs\replacer_selectFile.gif" alt="Select File" width=550>
    <p>The user can select one text file or multiple. This demonstrates the user
        selecting just one text file. </p>

    <h5>Adding replacement queries</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs\replacer_enterReplacements.gif" alt="Add replacements" width="550">
    <p>The user can enter multiple replacement queries. For each row, every instance of the
        text on the left found in the text file(s) will be replaced with the text
        on the right.</p>

    <h5>Result of first example</h5>
    <img src="screenshots\textReplace_before.png" alt="Text before" height=150>
    <img src="screenshots\textReplace_after.png" alt="Text after" height=150>
    <p>After pressing go, a message box will notify the user that the process is complete
        and a new file will be created with all of the replacements made. The first picture is the
        original text file and the second picture is the new text file.</p>

    <h5>Selecting multiple files and files with incorrect format</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs\replacer_multipleSelections.gif" alt="Select Multiple files" width=550>
    <p>If the user selects multiple files but some of them are not formatted as .txt
        files, only the text files will be used and an error message will appear.</p>

    <h5>Adding and deleting rows</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs\replacer_addDeleteRows.gif" alt="Add and Delete Rows" width=550>
    <p>The user can add up to 10 rows, and can also delete all rows except for the first
        row.</p>
