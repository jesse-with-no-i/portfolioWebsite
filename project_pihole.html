    <h4>Project Description</h4>
    <p>For this project, I programmed a Rasberry Pi Zero 2 W to block unwanted ads,
        tracking services, and malicious connections from any device connected to it
        by installing the Pi-Hole application onto it. This project involved working
        directly with firmware, manipulating network connections, and performing
        command line prompts in the Linux OS. Some of the specific tasks did were:
        set up and configure the Raspberry Pi out of the box; establish a connection
        between the device and my router; SSH into the device;
        create a static IPv4 address for the device, and more. I tested final product
        by connecting my phone to the Pi-Hole instead of the standard DNS servers,
        and I stopped getting ads for applications like YouTube.
