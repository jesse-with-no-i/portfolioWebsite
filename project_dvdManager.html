        <h1>DVD Manager</h1>
    </header>

    <p>This program was a project for my Software Engineering class. I was given
        the barebones code for a console-driven program that organized DVDs and was
        tasked with completing the console app to allow the following features:
        add/modify DVDs, remove DVDs, edit DVD details, get the total running time
        of the movies, and view the DVD collection. After completing the console app,
        I had to create a GUI for the app which accomplished the same things. Additionally,
        I added the feature of adding favorites and viewing only favorited DVDs.</p>

    <p>In order to complete the application, I had to write a class representing
        the collection of DVDs and write its methods to be used by the program. While
        writing the DVD collection class, I had to make sure all of its features could
        be utilized by a GUI class.</p>

    <p>This was an individual project (no collaborations), written entirely in Java
        and utilizing Java's "swing" library for the GUI.</p>

    <h2>Demo:</h2>
    <h5>Adding a DVD</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/add_dvd.gif" alt="Add DVD" width="1000" height="150">
    <p>This action took the details of a movie as input and added a DVD with
        those details to the collection. If the title already exists, the other
        details of the DVD will be modified instead.</p>

    <h5>Removing a DVD</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/remove_dvd.gif" alt="Remove DVD" width="1000" height="150">
    <p>This action took the title of a movie as input and removed its DVD from
        the collection.</p>

    <h5>Get DVDs by Rating</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/dvd_rating.gif" alt="Get DVD by rating" width="1000" height="150">
    <p>This took a rating such as "PG" or "R" as an input and returned all of the
        DVDs with that rating.</p>

    <h5>Get Total Running Time</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/dvd_total_time.gif" alt="Total Running Time" width="1000" height="150">
    <p>This returned the total running time of all the DVDs.</p>

    <h5>Edit DVD details</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/edit_dvd.gif" alt="Edit DVD" width="1000" height="150">
    <p>This action allowed the user to choose a DVD and edit its details, as well
        as add it to favorites.</p>

    <h5>View DVD details</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/view_dvd.gif" alt="View DVD" width="1000" height="300">
    <p>This allowed the user to select a movie and view its details, including a
        picture representing it.</p>

    <h5>Show Favorited DVDs</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/dvd_favorites.gif" alt="Show DVD Favorites" width="1000" height="300">
    <p>This feature allowed the user to view the details of the DVDs that have been
        favorited.</p>
