        <h1>Simple Shell Program</h1>
    </header>

    <h4>Project description</h4>
    <p>This program is an extention of the Linux command line written in C. The
        shell can run standard Linux commands by creating a child process and executing
        the command in the Linux terminal. There were two additional commands that
        my shell could run: yell and r. Yell would take the following argument and
        return it in all caps. The r command would return the last command that was
        executed. </p>

    <p>This was part of an individual assignment for my Operating Systems class. I was
        given example code to spawn a child process to run regular Linux commands.</p>

    <p>This demonstrates my shell, called jcshell, running commands like "cp" and "ls"
        which spawned a child process.</p>

    <h5>"yell" and "r" commands</h5>
    <img src="screenshots/shell_yell.png" alt="Yell and r commands" width="400" height="120">
    <p>This demonstrates the custom commands, yell and r, of jcshell. Yell returns the
        input in all caps. </p>
