        <h1>Boggle Board Solver</h1>
    </header>

    <h4>Project description</h4>
    <p>This program was written for an assignment in my Data Structures and Algorithms
        class. As part of the assignment, I wrote the methods for two classes - Boggle
        and Dictionary. The boggle class took a dictionary file and a boggle board as
        input and solved the board by finding all possible words based on the given
        dictionary. The solve could be saved onto a file for later viewing. It utilized
        recursion to solve the board.</p>
    <p>The Dictionary class served two main purposes: it allowed dictionaries to be
        loaded, saved, edited, and copied; it also assisted in solving the board by
        providing checks on the words and keeping track of the amount of words. This
        class is a Tree type class, so all operations on it were written for a tree.</p>

    <p>This was part of an individual assignment for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.
        I was provided with the skeleton of each class (names of methods and attributes).</p>
