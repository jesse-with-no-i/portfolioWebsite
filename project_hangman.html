    <h4>Project description</h4>
    <p>This was a project for my MIPS Assembly class where me and one other collaborator
        were tasked with creating a game of our choice written entirely in register-level
        MIPS Assembly. My peer and I chose to create Hangman. The goal of the game is
        for the player to guess the computer's randomly chosen word before running out
        of guesses. We wrote functions to validate guesses, choose randomly from a list,
        draw the "hangman" on the screen, and more. It was a console-based app.</p>

    <p>This was part of a collaborative assignment. The code was written from scratch
        and no external libraries were used.</p>

        <h4>Skills Demonstrated</h4>
