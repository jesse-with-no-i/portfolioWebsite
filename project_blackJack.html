    <h4>Project description.</h4>
    <p>This application simulates the card game: Blackjack. You, the player, get to
        place your bet and play against an automated dealer. Just like in Blackjack,
        the player with the better cards wins. It keeps track of how much money you
        have, and that number persists even after the game is closed and reopened.
        If you lose, the bet you place is taken from your bank. If you win, your bet
        is added to your bank. You can also tie with the dealer.</p>
    <p>This project was written entirely in Python, utilizing the Tkinter library
        for the GUI. It was written entirely from scratch. I didn't collaborate with
        other programmers for this project.</p>

    <h2>Demo:</h2>
    <h5>Placing bet and pressing "Start"</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/bet_and_start.gif" alt="Bet and Start" width="300" height="315">
    <p>You start by choosing a bet between $10 and what you have in the bank. Then
        you press start, which will open up the game window.</p>

    <h5>Playing your turn</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/hit_and_stand.gif" alt="Hit and Stand" width="300" height="525">
    <p>The game window pops up, showing you your cards and one of the dealer's cards.
        You can decide to hit or stand as long as your total is 21 or less. Your turn
        ends once you press "Stand."</p>

    <h5>Dealer wins</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/dealer_wins.gif" alt="Dealer Wins" width="300" height="525">
    <p>In this scenario, the dealer wins by ending up with a better total than the
        player.</p>

    <h5>Player wins</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/player_wins.gif" alt="Player Wins" width="300" height="525">
    <p>This is what happens when the player ends up with a better total than the
        dealer.</p>

    <h5>A few more features</h5>
    <img src="demo_gifs/bust_and_broke.gif" alt="Bust and Broke" width="300" height="525">
    <img src="demo_gifs/invalid_bet.gif" alt="Invalid Bet" width="300" height="315">
    <img src="demo_gifs/reset_bank.gif" alt="Invalid Bet" width="300" height="315">
    <p>This section demonstrates busting (getting higher than 21), running out of money, placing an
        invalid bet, and resetting the bank.</p>
